# feeds

The RSS feeds I subscribe to, mainly about iOS, maths and software engineering in general.
This list is generated by [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org), an open source and self-hostable aggregator I use to keep up with all of this content, while controling my data.

## Getting started
1. Choose you RSS client or service. I recommend to use FreshRSS.
2. Get the OPML file and import it.
3. Read.
